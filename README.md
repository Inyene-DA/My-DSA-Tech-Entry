# Inyene Udoekong - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm Inyene!  
I have been serving in my career as a 
HSE Coordinator with an analytical background in 
Electrical and Electronics Engineering.I
am currently on a learning track to 
exploring the tech space as a Data Analyst. 
I am pretty new to this space, and hopeful it will be a luscious mix of exciting and challenging.
I look forward to getting inspired by geniuses here and would love to 
collaborate as I advance in skills, knowledge 
and experience as a Data Analyst. Special thanks to 
Digital Skill-Up Africa in collaboration 
with the training institution; 
Incubator Hub for getting me started 
on a platter of free tuition, intensive learning period 
with amazingly friendly and competent tutors. 
I am so excited to put my technical, 
analytical and creative skills, honed during the course 
of the entry-level training into the practice of solving
complex problem as a Data Analyst. Thinking aloud! My Data Analytics skill would greatly enhance HSE.

During my training, I learned to 
work with complex data, extracting them from different data sources while taking them 
through the transformation processes and getting 
the data ready for analysis and visualization. 
I also gained good hands-on experience on data 
management and statistical analysis which is expedient as a data analyst.

I love to scribble and develop contents for 
educational and inspirational purposes as a hobby. 
I also enjoy exploring design templates that 
resonate with my mood. I look forward to 
discovering so much more in the course of my 
new career to bringing real solutions to complex 
problems and grace my space with the happiness 
that a good satisfaction through projects and 
collaboration brings.

I am a Christian and I believe in Jesus Christ, 
the Son of The Living God. 

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics related conversations.
