This is a chronicle into my fascinating journey into the Tech space. DSA got me started with Data Analysis. It's been such an amazing experience with our facilitators at Incubator Hub.

I began an intensive learning and hands on training on the use of microsoft excel up to an intermediate level as an edge, i equally explored the use of SQL for storing and managing data for subsequent access, retrieval and manipulation.
